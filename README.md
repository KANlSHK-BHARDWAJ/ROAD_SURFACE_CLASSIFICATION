# Road Surface Classification Project

This project aims to classify different types of road surfaces using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- `Model/`: Contains the trained model (`road_surface_model.pth`).
- `Model_Testing/`: Contains code for testing the model (`video_test.py`).
- `Model_Training/`: Contains code for training the model (`surface_classification_model.py`).
- `Training_Result/`: Contains results from model training (`training_results.png`).
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:KANISHK-BHARDWAJ/ROAD_SURFACE_CLASSIFICATION.git
   cd ROAD_SURFACE_CLASSIFICATION
2. Install Python dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Use the provided scripts in Model_Testing/ and Model_Training/ to test and train the model.
